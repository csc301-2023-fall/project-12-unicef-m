# Project 12 Backend

Prior to working on the backend, make sure that you create a virtual environment in the backend folder. To do so, first navigate to the backend directory, and then type the following command:
```
python -m venv venv
```
Once the venv folder has been created, activate the environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
If the folder contains a requirements.txt, install all required (python) libraries using the requirements.txt after you've created the venv. Before pushing, ensure that if you've downloaded new libraries, you create a new requirements.txt by running the command:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
