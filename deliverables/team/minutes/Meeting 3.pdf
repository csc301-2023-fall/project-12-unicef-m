Meeting notes:

Config file:
- make it 
- every chat with dataset and new names 

how do we get the datasets:
- do they have to know the name?
- retrieve them from the API 


- example datasets and dashboards in the superset repo 
- cli tool for creating a superuse account -> load examples into the instance
    - have those examples to use
    - not have multiple datasets with the same schema in the way that UNICEF uses it 
    - generate some snethic ones 
    - dashboard with one or two charts -> enough to test the functionality 
    - world bank and baby names dataset 
        - has a time axis -> can be split into decades 
        - turn one example dataset into many 
        - close to UNICEF use cases 




- how to check if dataset is viable:
    - superset keeps track of the schema
    - retrieve the schema from API
    - compare the tempates from the 

- cloning across instances
    - configuring the dashboard in staging, promote it to production instance 
    - same operation
    - datasource might have same name but diff on production instance
    - accross instance

    - different host name for the API endpoints
    - same API credentials, hot name, IP address 
        - accorss instance —> creating the dashboard configurations on production instance with the kenya datasource 
        - two different host names or IP address 
        - same API calls retrieved in staging 

- dashboard you want to clone that has a datasource 
- destination might be on the same instance or different instance
    - config file —> specify what the available instances 
    - save host name and IP address for each instance 
    - store the username and password
    - select the instance before selecting the new datasource
        - datasources are specific to the instance
- a new name 

access to superset instance hosted on the cloud with sample data 
- he can do it yay
- can get some example datasets 
- can maybe get it done 
- has an old version on a venv that he can try to give us access to
