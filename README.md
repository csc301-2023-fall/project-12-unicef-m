We will update the README once we have another meeting with the partner on Wednesday October 4 and with our TA to discuss the complexities mentioned in tutorial. 


Partner Intro:
Our primary point of contact for this project is Evan Wheeler (ewheeler@unicef.org). UNICEF is a multinational organization dedicated to protecting, assisting, and creating environments for children to grow up with the resources they need. 


1. Project Description
   Our project is a dashboard cloning tool built on top of apache superset that would allow for a form of version control within the application that would allow for the propogation of changes from the configuration to the parent dashboard to the cloned children.
   
2. Key Features
   Our primary feature is, as mentioned above, a version control system that would allow a user to make changes to a dashboard's configuration and update the cloned dashboards. In addition to being able to clone dashboards within the same instance we plan to implement cloning across instances of superset instances

3. Instructions for Utilizing the application

4. Key development requirements installing and running the application


5. Deployment and Github workflow, where and how are tasks managed (e.g., are you using Linear.app, Jira, GitHub Project...)

6. External dependencies and third-party software

7. Coding Standards and Guidelines

8. Liscences
